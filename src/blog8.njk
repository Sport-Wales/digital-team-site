    <p class="mt-3"><em>“Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers” – Seth Godin</em></p>
    <p class="mt-3"><strong>Designing the right digital products and services must start and end with the customer</strong> (or ‘user’). But who are the users, what do they look like and where are they from, and most importantly, what do they need?</p>
    <p class="mt-3">These are some of the questions we ask ourselves in the Digital & Service Design Team when met with a new project. To develop and work on projects that really matter, and have a positive and lasting impact, we encourage you to think through these questions too, and identify the customer or <strong>‘user need’.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">What is ‘user need’</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">A ‘user need’ is <strong>something a person [or people] want or require</strong> when using a product, service, or system. It is the speific requirement that helps them accomplish a task or to reach a goal.</p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">Why is understanding ‘user need’ important?</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Without a clear understanding of user need, <strong>you are purely guessing and working on assumptions.</strong> It’s very likely that you could end up designing or building something that has usability issues, design flaws, doesn’t completely fit user needs, or worse yet, simply has no market fit or relevance in the real world.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">By understanding users' needs firstly, and then their behaviours and preferences, we can create products and services that truly cater to their requirements. It helps us make informed decisions, mitigate assumptions, and ensure that the end result aligns with their expectations, ultimately leading to more successful and user-centric solutions.</p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">When should ‘user need’ be captured?</h2>
    <p class="mt-3"><strong>Digital products and services must start, end, and continue with users.</strong></p>
    <p class="mt-3">Looking to understand user needs from the outset by defining the ‘problem’ is akin to shining a light on the heart of the matter, peeling back the layers of assumptions and preconceptions, ensuring that we’re addressing the actual issues faced, rather than jumping to solutions.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">But we must also continue to listen to users throughout projects and beyond, even after a project has come to an end. Doing so is like having a compass that keeps you headed in the right direction, helping you navigate through unfamiliar challenges and ensuring that your efforts remain aligned with the ever-evolving needs and expectations of your users.</p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">Whose role is understanding ‘user need’ – yours or ours?</h2>
    <p class="mt-3"><em>“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much” – Helen Keller</em></p>
    <p class="mt-3">The Digital & Service Design Team do have user research capability and capacity and can support in getting a deeper understanding of users needs, their journeys, and their experiences.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">However, we all have a role to play in developing initiatives that genuinely meet the needs of those we work with and for. It takes a culture within an organisation to be acutely aware of who users are and what they want and need, and then to apply that insight in the most appropriate way.</p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">What should I think through when trying to understand ‘user need’?</h2>
    <p class="mt-3"><strong>Getting an initial understanding of user needs needn’t be complex.</strong> There are three key aspects to consider. We’ve called them the Three UI’s. Giving thought and clear answers to these will ensure that a project proposal and its continued growth is and remains user-centric:</p>
    <p class="mt-3 underline">User need: "If I had 20 days to solve a problem, I would use 19 days to define the problem”</p>
    <p class="mt-3">A successful digital and service design project should be founded on a genuine and clear understanding of user needs, pain-points, and problems. Without clarity, we could be working on the wrong thing, or worse yet, something that has no use or relevance in the real world.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">If you are unable to articulate the ‘problem’ or ‘need’ clearly and concisely, talk to your users, observe their actions, note inefficiency and the impact this has on them. Consider using the following prompt (you can copy and paste this):</p>

    <p class="mt-3 underline">User Impact: “Success should not be measured by the size of your pay, but by the difference you make in people’s lives”</p>
    <p class="mt-3">You may have a clear understanding or who your users are, and what they need, and what their currently ‘problems are’, but how big is the impact?</p>
    <p class="mt-3">Is the development of a solution a ‘nice-to-have’, or will it fundamentally and positively change users working or personal experience? Will a product or service cause friction, or will it simplify their life? Does it impact only a few individuals, or will a successful project have wide ranging reach and impact?</p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">A Final Word</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Understanding and meeting user needs is crucial to making products that users love, reducing risks, working efficiently, and coming up with new and exciting ideas. <strong>Keep users at the heart.</strong></p>
