            <h2 class="mt-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mt-3">Two of the Digital & Service Design Team’s principles focus on the importance of understanding and
                basing decision-making upon user need and insight:</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Principle No. 1: Design Services Based on User Needs</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">Never rely on assumptions. Find out who the users of the service are or would be and why they need the
                service. Talk to users and let their needs guide our design. We’re building services and solutions, not just products
                and websites. Solutions must meet evidenced user needs.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Principle No. 3: Make Decision Based on Insight</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">We’ll use resources like user interviews, metrics, data insight and research to guide our
                decision-making. Again, don’t rely on assumptions and use all the available evidence. We’ll use creative ways of finding
                insight to understand needs if evidence doesn’t exist.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Given the stated importance of understanding user needs in the project decision-making process, a
                framework is clearly required to assist in that exercise to efficiently and accurately ascertain whether a potential
                project is founded on a clear understanding of user needs.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 mt-9 text-3xl font-bold">The Power of Understanding User Needs</h2>
            <p class="mt-3">We have encouraged staff in a recent document entitled ‘The Power of Understanding User Needs’ that
                “getting an initial understanding of user needs needn’t be complex”. That document called on those proposing projects to
                consider what we call the Three UI’s:</p>
            <ol class="list-disc ml-8">
                <li class="mt-3">
                    <strong>User Issue</strong>
                    - A successful digital and service design project should be founded on a genuine and clear understanding of user needs,
                    pain-points, and problems. Without clarity, we could be working on the wrong thing, or worse yet, something that has no
                    use or relevance in the real world.
                </li>
                <li class="mt-3">
                    <strong>User Identity</strong>
                    - Thinking of your audience as ‘everyone’ is a great way to fail in designing a product or service, as it removes all
                    constraints meaning that focused work becomes impossible. When a product or service is aimed at ‘everyone’, valid
                    arguments for every feature and platform can be made. Instead, clarity on who ‘typical’ or ‘early adopter’ users will be
                    is required, including, who they are, where do they come from, and what tasks are they trying to accomplish.
                </li>
                <li class="mt-3">
                    <strong>User Impact</strong>
                    - You may have a clear understanding or who your users are, and what they need, and what their currently ‘problems are’,
                    but how big is the impact? Is the development of a solution a ‘nice-to-have’, or will it fundamentally and positively
                    change users working or personal experience? Will a product or service cause friction, or will it simplify their life?
                    Does it impact only a few individuals, or will a successful project have wide ranging reach and impact?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-3">Given that we have encouraged the organisation to think through the Three UI’s as they design and
                propose potential digital projects, the framework the Digital & Service Design Team will use for decision-making will
                largely focus on the same aspects.</p>
