    <p class="mt-3">Yes, after 13 years at Sport Wales I got lost recently.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">I was heading to the <em>Digispace</em>, which (apparently) was over by the Jubilee Hall. </p>
    <p class="mt-3">Who knew that the old Community Sport office had been split in two? Or that there’s life (an old stair well) passed the Welsh Gymnastics office.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">It was proper first day at work stuff, but I eventually made it to the Digispace.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">So, what is the Digispace? If you’re thinking Las Vegas Sphere you’re well off the mark, although it did prove to be our own little desert oasis.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">Basically, it’s a little office space that enabled the Digital and Service Design Team to spend time together in a dedicated area.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">I must admit I was a little bit sceptical about it and taking people away from the ‘main’ part of the building and shared workspace.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">But, I admit, I was wrong.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">The space was a pilot for September 2023 to try and bring the team closer together, have more conversations and turbo charge some areas of work.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">And it worked. The positive culture and joint working has made a significant difference. </p>
    <p class="mt-3">Whether we’ll have the Digispace moving forward is not yet confirmed. But we have a great new base to move on from and want to continue to work in an <a href="https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/agile-project-management/what-are-the-principles-of-agile-working/">Agile</a> way.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">The other benefit was having a place to store the basketball machine. If you get a chance, see if you can shoot 100 in a minute and be the only one (other than Anselm) to hit three figures!</p>
