    <h1 class="my-20 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none tracking-tight text-gray-900 md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl dark:text-white">The Ten Digital and Service Design Principles</h1>
    <p>
        The ten Principles are the foundation on which we build services for our users.
    </p>
    <p>
        These principles have been put in place to allow us to work more effectively with each other, and colleagues across Sport Wales and the sector. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">1. Design services based on user needs</h2>
    <p>
        Never rely on assumptions. Find out who the users of the service are or would be and why they need the service. Talk to users and let their needs guide our design. We’re building services and solutions, not just products and websites. Solutions must meet evidenced user needs. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">2. Bring people togehter for the long-term</h2>
    <p>
        Good solutions are sustainable solutions. We’ll ensure the right people and resources are in place to see services and products supported over the long-term. Sustainability also means ensuring our services meet long-term user needs. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">3. Make decisions based on insight</h2>
    <p>
        We’ll use resources like user interviews, metrics, data insight and research to guide our decision-making. Again, don’t rely on assumptions and use all the available evidence. We’ll use creative ways of finding insight to understand needs if evidence doesn’t exist.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">4. Deliver together</h2>
    <p>
        Designing successful services needs people with all different types of skills. From content design, product management, service design, subject matter experts and digital development; all contributions are valued and needed. We’ll value diversity of background and opinion.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">5. Create inclusive and accessible services</h2>
    <p>
        We’ll deliver services that are accessible to all, regardless of disability, digital literacy or social background. We’ll design our services in Welsh and English. When creating for the web, we’ll be guided by accessibility best practices and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We’ll make transitions between physical, offline, and digital services smooth, leaving no users behind. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">6. Create integrated services</h2>
    <p>
        New services work with or enhance our infrastructure and can be built on over time. They’re based on open standards and the cloud. They avoid dependencies on a single vendor and can be integrated with other software by design. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">7. Share work with others</h2>
    <p>
        By openly and regularly sharing our work with colleagues, partners, the public sector and the sports sector, we can gain feedback and keep pushing ourselves. We'll share our successes and our failures.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">8. Test and change</h2>
    <p>
        Create. Test. Change. Then test again. We’ll take small steps often, releasing early live solutions and testing them with users. This process is sometimes called ‘iterating’, and it’ll be a guiding principle for how we produce solutions over the long term. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">9. Be agile and adapt</h2>
    <p>
        We’ll respond to feedback, user needs, and insight as we go. We’ll start with the problem we’re trying to solve, and not rush to find a solution. We’ll rise to shifting needs and meet change with an open mind. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">10. Learn and innovate</h2>
    <p>
        We want a culture where we can explore new ways of thinking and creating. Services and products should adapt to new evidence. Digital practices and service design are ever-changing fields, and we'll dedicate time to learning and innovating. 
    </p>
