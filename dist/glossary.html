<h2>Frontend</h2>
<p>The frontend refers to the user interface of a website or application that users interact with directly. It involves designing and coding elements that users see and interact with.</p>

<h2>Fullstack</h2>
<p>Full stack development is work that requires expertise in both front-end and back-end development, capable of working on all aspects of a digital project.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system used by developers to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage software projects.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub is a web-based platform and version control system that enables developers to collaborate on code, manage software projects, and track changes. It provides features for code hosting, issue tracking, and collaborative development, making it a central hub for software development teams to work together and manage their code repositories.</p>

<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
<p>Information architecture involves organizing and structuring content and data within a website or application to enhance usability and findability for users.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>‘Infrastructure’ encompasses the fundamental hardware and software components that support the operation of IT systems, including servers, networks, storage and more.</p>

<h2>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
<p>An IDE is a software suite that provides tools for coding, debugging, testing, and project management in a single integrated environment.</p>

<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
<p>Interaction design focuses on designing the interactive elements and behaviors of a digital product to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>

<h2>Malware</h2>
<p>Malware is malicious software designed to harm or compromise computer systems, including viruses, spyware, ransomware, and Trojans.</p>

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>A network is a system of interconnected devices and components that enable data communication and resource sharing, either locally or globally.</p>

<h2>Persona</h2>
<p>Personas are fictional characters or user profiles created to represent the typical traits, behaviors, and needs of different user groups, aiding in user-centered design and decision-making.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>A prototype is a working or non-working model of a digital product or service created for testing and evaluation, helping designers and stakeholders visualize the final product and gather user feedback.</p>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
<p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures a website or application adapts and displays correctly on various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.</p>

<h2>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h2>
<p>Software delivered over the internet, usually on a subscription basis, allowing users to access and use applications without local installations.</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<p>A server is a computer or system that provides services, data, or resources to other devices or clients over a network, such as hosting websites or handling data storage.</p>

<h2>Service Blueprint</h2>
<p>A service blueprint is a visual representation of a service&#39;s components, processes, and interactions, helping to analyze and improve service design and delivery.</p>

<h2>Service design</h2>
<p>Service design is a multidisciplinary approach focussed on creating and improving services to enhance user experience, combining elements of user research, prototyping and user-centred design.</p>

<h2>Sprint</h2>
<p>In the context of agile project management, a sprint is a time-boxed development cycle typically lasting 2-4 weeks during which a cross-functional team works on a defined set of tasks or user stories, aiming to produce a potentially shippable product increment.</p>
